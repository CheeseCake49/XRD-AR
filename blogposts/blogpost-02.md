# Scanning the Ground Floor: A Step Forward

Today was all about refining our approach to 3D scanning the ground floor. Last week we tried to capture everything in one go, but the file size became unmanageable and the software simply couldn’t process it. This time, we took a different path—literally. By dividing the space into smaller sections, we managed to complete the scan successfully.

## The Scanning Route

We started in the **canteen** and then made our way through **hub B**, past the **reception**, and into **hub C**. From there, we continued toward **hub A**, eventually looping back to the canteen. Finally, we scanned the **main central area**. Breaking it up into these segments proved to be much more efficient and avoided the file size issues we faced before.

## Tools & Challenges

We initially used the trial version of **Lighter**, but quickly hit a limitation when we ran out of available scans. To finish the work, we switched to **Polycam**. This turned out to be a pleasant surprise—Polycam’s files include **color data**, which gave the scans a strikingly more vivid and realistic quality compared to Lighter’s outputs.

## Into Unity

Once the scans were complete, we imported the files into **Unity**. The process involved identifying each area and aligning the separate models together. The result isn’t perfectly one-to-one, but it’s accurate enough for our current needs. Seeing the different pieces fit together and recognizing each space was a satisfying milestone.

## Next Steps

The next step is to **push everything to GitHub**, ensuring the work is properly stored and ready for further development. From here, we can continue refining the alignment, experiment with interactivity, and explore how to make the 3D environment more usable and immersive.
